# Qt Bachelor Thesis Repository
## About this Repository
The following repository is dedicated to the bachelor thesis work by Eimen Oueslati, Nils Petter Sk√•lerud, and Cecilia Norevik Bratlie. The developed software is for the Qt Group.

The core goal is to develop a native and open-source parser and renderer for the MapBox vector format using the Qt framework. The binary data is retrieved from a server, parsed, and rendered on the screen. The Qt framework offers cross-platform C++ APIs for all essential tasks, including networking, binary file parsing, vector data rendering, and creating user interface elements.
