### Tested software versions
The tools used in this project as well their versions are described in the table below. We expect slightly newer versions to keep working with the software.

| Tool          | Version          |
|---------------|------------------|
| Windows x64   | 22H2 (22621.3007)|
| Qt            | 6.7.0-beta2      |
| Ninja         | 1.10.2           |
| vcpkg         | 2024-01-11       |
| Protobuf      | 3.21.12          |

### Tested compilers
Windows x64:
- Microsoft Visual C++ (MSVC) v143

## Setup for Windows

### Installing MSVC through Visual Studio
This step is to grab the MSVC compiler.

Go to [https://visualstudio.microsoft.com](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com) (Likely needs a reference). Go to the bottom left of the page and download "Community 2022". From the installer, begin installing "Visual Studio Community 2022". You will need the module called "Desktop Development with C++" with the following components:
- MSVC v143
- C++ CMake tools for Windows

### Installing Qt (including CMake and Ninja)
Go to [https://www.qt.io/download-open-source](https://www.qt.io/download-open-source) and download the Qt online installer. From here you will download "Qt 6.7.0-beta2" with the following components, some are optional based on platform and compiler:
- MSVC 2019 64-bit
- Additional libraries
  - Qt Protobuf and Qt gRPC (TP)
- Developer and Designer Tools
  - CMake 3.27.7
  - Ninja 1.10.2

### Installing vcpkg and protobuf
The official installation instructions can be found at [https://vcpkg.io/en/getting-started](https://vcpkg.io/en/getting-started). We have written down all commands necessary below, you do not need to follow the link unless you want to customize your installation. For these instructions, we will install vcpkg to the root of the C: drive. Open your terminal in any directory and run the following commands:
```
cd C:  
git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg.git
.\vcpkg\bootstrap-vcpkg.bat
.\vcpkg\vcpkg install protobuf
```
Note: The final step might take a while.

## Building with Qt Creator
Open the CMakeLists.txt file in Qt Creator.

If you are using Windows at this point, you will get an error when running the initial CMake configuration step, similar to the one shown below. This is because we need to point CMake to look at the vcpkg toolchain to find dependant libraries. To fix this, navigate to "Projects", then under the Kit "Desktop Qt 6.7.0 MSVC2019 64bit", select the tab "Initial Configuration". Select the field "Additional CMake options" and input the command-line flag:
```
"-DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=C:\vcpkg\scripts\buildsystems\vcpkg.cmake"
```
Then press the button "Re-Configure with Initial Parameters".
