# Qt Bachelor Thesis Repository
## About this Repository
The following repository is dedicated to the bachelor thesis work by Eimen Oueslati, Nils Petter Sk√•lerud, and Cecilia Norevik Bratlie. The developed software is for the Qt Group.

The core goal is to develop a native and open-source parser and renderer for the MapBox vector format using the Qt framework. The binary data is retrieved from a server, parsed, and rendered on the screen. The Qt framework offers cross-platform C++ APIs for all essential tasks, including networking, binary file parsing, vector data rendering, and creating user interface elements.


## Building Qt From Source and Rendering a Tile

This is just a small test application to see if we can render MapBox maps with Qt.

### Getting started

Build qt from source: https://code.qt.io/cgit/qt/qt5.git/ (Needed because of a recent bugfix in qtgrpc).

Use the following submodlues:

```./init-repository --module-subset="qtbase,qtgrpc,qtrepotools" -f```

(Repotools is only required for gerrit to work)

Make sure you got all dependencies for qtgrpc installed (maybe not all are needed):

* libprotobuf-dev
* protobuf-compiler
* protobuf-compiler-grpc
* libgrpc++-dev
* libgrpc-dev

Also see the introduction here: https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/qtprotobuf-index.html

Compile with (e.g. in a new folder qt5-build, next to your qt5 folder)

```./qt5/configure -developer-build -nomake examples -make tests```

If you build Qt sucessfully, make sure that QtCreator knows where your Qt build is.
Then you can just open the CMakeList.txt file of this project in QtCreator.

### Test Data

The testdata contains a style sheet (tiles.json) from maptiler.com as well as three tiles (e.g. z12x2170y1190.mvt), also downloaded from maptiler.com.

You can get more test data if you make a maptiler account: https://www.maptiler.com/

You can also use my key(aTD2rOqjSNUxK8sO2oEz), but please don't do anything that gets me into trouble:

So here is a stylesheet: https://api.maptiler.com/maps/basic-v2/style.json?key=aTD2rOqjSNUxK8sO2oEz

And this is the url to get the tiles:
https://api.maptiler.com/tiles/v3/tiles.json?key=aTD2rOqjSNUxK8sO2oEz

that forwards to:
```https://api.maptiler.com/tiles/v3/{z}/{x}/{y}.pbf?key=aTD2rOqjSNUxK8sO2oEz```
(You have to fill out x,y,z yourself)


### Status

* 28.12.23: The json style and the mvt tiles are parsed (incompletely) and some fill rendering is happening.
* 29.12.23: Improved rendering a bit. Colors seem correct in the example and added lines.
